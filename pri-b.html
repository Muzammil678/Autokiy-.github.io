        At AutoKiya we are dedicated in protecting your personal information and informing you about how we use it. This privacy policy applies to transactions and activities and data gathered through the use of AutoKiya Platform. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may revise it without notice. This privacy policy was last revised on November 15, 2016. Each time you use the AutoKiya Platform or provide us with the information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.

<h2>DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h2>
In order to operate the AutoKiya Platform and to provide you with information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we may use the personal information i.e. information that could be used to contact you directly (without using the AutoKiya Platform) such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address) or demographic information (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, pin code, username, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information. You represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide us with any such contact information. Demographic information is divided into two categories: non-public information, which consists of ride transaction information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the AutoKiya platform; and public information, which consists of all other demographic information. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION We use your email address, phone number and your other personal information to help us efficiently operate the AutoKiya Platform, to contact you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the AutoKiya Platform (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or important news that could affect your relationship with AutoKiya). These types of communications are known as â€œOperational Communications.â€ In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers. To operate the AutoKiya Platform, including processing your transactions and supporting your activities on the AutoKiya Platform, we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services, and order fulfilment. We require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose.
<h2>HOW WE USE THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA</h2>
We may review all demographic data. We may use demographic information to tailor the AutoKiya Platform and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to you as a user of the AutoKiya Platform. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which particular AutoKiya Users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group.
<h2>HOW TO EDIT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
To edit your information please send us an email at support@shahisawari.pk
<h2>INFORMATION RETENTION</h2>
To preserve the integrity of our databases, standard procedure calls for us to retain information submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. AutoKiya understands your submissions as consent to store all your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if we so wish. We will also respond to written member requests to support@shahisawari.pk to nullify account information in case of fair usage of our platform. Also, by using the AutoKiya Platform, you do hereby represent and warrant that you understand and agree that all information submitted by you through the AutoKiya Platform or otherwise to AutoKiya becomes the property of AutoKiya and may be used in the sole discretion of AutoKiya in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.

<h2>SPECIAL CASES IN WHICH WE MAY SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
Your personal information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or new-website/assets, or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose personal information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of the AutoKiya Platform. We also may disclose your personal information to our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control. Whenever personal information is disclosed under this paragraph, we may also disclose your demographic information along with it, on a non-anonymous basis. All of our parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive your personal information or non-anonymous demographic information from us will comply with the terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such information.
